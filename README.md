# Potential Applications of Innovative AI-Based Tools in Hydrogen Energy Development: Leveraging Large Language Model Technologies

Abstract:
Renewable energy development is crucial due to fossil fuels' environmental impact. Hydrogen energy, a promising alternative to reduce emissions, faces challenges in production, storage, and distribution. This paper explores the applications of ChatGPT, a large language model by OpenAI, in revolutionizing hydrogen energy research and development. The study investigates the advantages, limitations, and future outlook of AI and ChatGPT in accelerating hydrogen adoption during energy transition. To demonstrate ChatGPT's capabilities, four case studies were executed: (1) Evaluation of hydrogen production processes, identifying solid oxide electrolysis as the most efficient technology; (2) Implementation of an LSTM-based predictive maintenance system for hydrogen facilities, achieving 97% accuracy; (3) Analysis of policy impacts on hydrogen adoption, demonstrating carbon pricing's effectiveness; (4) Development of an XGBoost model for hydrogen production forecasting, achieving an RÂ² of 0.9996. The results of this study highlight ChatGPT's transformative potential in optimizing various aspects of hydrogen energy development, accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future.
